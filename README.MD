## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need a server environment with the following installed:

* A web server with PHP support (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
* Python 3.x
* `pip` 
* `crontab`, or any other way to routinely run the script.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Clone this repository to your local machine or server. It's recommended to place it in your web server's public directory (e.g., `/var/www/html/`).
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/peter.rs/langle.git
    cd langle
    ```

2.  **Install Python Dependencies**
    The required Python packages are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using `pip`.
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set Up the Daily Cron Job**
    A cron job is needed to run the `script.py` automatically every day at midnight. This script generates the puzzle for the new day.

    * Open your crontab editor:
        ```sh
        crontab -e
        ```
    * Add the following line to the file. This schedule will run the script every day at `00:00` (midnight).
        ```crontab
        0 0 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/project/script.py
        ```
